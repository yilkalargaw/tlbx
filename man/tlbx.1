.SS NAME
.PP
tlbx - a simple podman wrapper
.SS Why
.PP
tlbx is valuable for use cases such as:
.IP "1." 3
Systems on which installing applications is difficult or discouraged,
such as Fedora Silverblue (https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/).
.IP "2." 3
Systems on which you do not have the administrative ability to install
applications.
.IP "3." 3
Setting up a development environment which you intend to back up or
deploy to other systems.
If you don\[aq]t know all the applications that will be required \f[I]a
priori\f[R], you can set up a tlbx as an ongoing work in progress.
When it needs to move, \f[V]podman commit\f[R] the container and
\f[V]skopeo copy\f[R] the resulting image.
.IP "4." 3
Quickly accessing packages that aren\[aq]t readily available from your
distro\[aq]s default repositories, but which are available from a
fast-moving or less restrictive distro such as Arch
Linux (https://archlinux.org).
.IP "5." 3
Any situation in which you don\[aq]t want to run the package manager as
root, such as using an app you might not trust.
In such a case you may also consider the \f[V]-n\f[R] option to
\f[V]tlbx create\f[R].
.SS Installing
.PP
Copy to a directory in \f[V]PATH\f[R], such as
\f[V]\[ti]/.local/bin\f[R].
Podman is the only requirement.
Currently there are no distro packages available for tlbx itself.
.SS Usage
.SS create
.PP
\f[V]tlbx create [-i IMGNAME] [-c CONTAINERNAME] [-h HOSTNAME] [-n]\f[R]
.PP
Example: \f[V]tlbx create -i centos:8 -c centosbox\f[R]
.PP
The default image is Docker\[aq]s official Alpine
Linux (https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine).
The default container name is \f[V]-tlbx\f[R] appended to the image
name, excluding the image tag.
The default hostname is \f[V]tlbx\f[R].
.PP
Your home directory is bind-mounted to the container unless the
\f[V]-n\f[R] switch is passed.
.SS enter
.PP
\f[V]tlbx enter [PODMAN_EXEC_OPTS...] CONTAINERNAME [CMD [ARGS...]]\f[R]
.PP
If zero arguments are given after the container name, then the
\f[V]-i\f[R] and \f[V]-t\f[R] podman options are implied, and the
user\[aq]s shell as specified in the container\[aq]s
\f[V]/etc/passwd\f[R] is run as a login shell.
.PP
Otherwise, any arguments passed after the container name will be the
entry command; In that case, \f[V]-i\f[R] and/or \f[V]-t\f[R] must be
passed before the container name if wanted.
.PP
Example: \f[V]tlbx enter centosbox\f[R] results in an interactive
\f[V]bash -l\f[R]
.PP
Example: \f[V]tlbx enter centosbox bash\f[R] exits immediately due to no
tty being requested for the shell
.PP
Example: \f[V]tlbx enter --user=root -it centosbox dnf install ruby\f[R]
runs a single interactive package installation
.PP
A tlbx container can be entered concurrently from multiple ttys, and the
entry command doesn\[aq]t have to be a shell, or interactive.
.SS list
.PP
\f[V]tlbx list\f[R]
.PP
The list subcommand shows the subset of podman containers that are
labeled with \f[V]com.gitlab.uppercat.tlbx\f[R].
This label is applied automatically by \f[V]tlbx create\f[R].
.SS rm
.PP
\f[V]tlbx rm [-f] CONTAINERNAME [CONTAINERNAME...]]\f[R]
.PP
Example: \f[V]tlbx rm centosbox\f[R]
.PP
If the container is running (because it has been entered), the
\f[V]-f\f[R] switch is required.
\f[V]tlbx rm\f[R] can only affect containers created with
\f[V]tlbx create\f[R], because it filters for the
\f[V]com.gitlab.uppercat.tlbx\f[R] label.
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
See the
wiki (https://gitlab.com/uppercat/tlbx/-/wikis/troubleshooting).* This a
fork of <https://gitlab.com/uppercat/tlbx> repo.
It was meant to store my personal setting until they are merged by the
upstream but the upstream does not seems to inactive.
Just to be sure to If I make important changes I will also make a merge
request to upstream.
